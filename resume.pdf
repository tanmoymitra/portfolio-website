Note: This file represents the original PDF resume that was uploaded. In a real implementation, you would copy the actual PDF file (TANMOY MITRA RESUME_1751455660784.pdf) to this location. Since I cannot generate binary files, this is a placeholder indicating where the PDF should be placed for the download functionality to work properly.

The file should be renamed to "resume.pdf" and placed in the root directory alongside the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
